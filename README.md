An email component compiler using gulp and nunjucks.

**DISCLAIMER**
The actual HTML/CSS has NOT been tested to work responsively and in different ESP's. It is just a template for the initial set up of the component compiler. You will need to create new clients in gulpfile.js and write your own components!
